    Your story is:


    The other day, I was in trouble. It all started
    when I saw a very Happy Zebra
    eat down the hallway. "Wow!"
    I yelled. I could think to relax over and over.
    Miraculously, that caused it to stop, but not before it tried
    to sleep right in front of my family.
